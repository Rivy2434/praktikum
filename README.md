# Projects
## Car price prediction

This project aims to create a model capable of fast cars price prediction based on their characteristics. For this purpose the historical data of car sales compiled from different sources were used. There are technical characteristics, prices, vehicle configurations.

It was important to compare different models and choose the best taking into account:

metric score (RMSE)
prediction speed
model training time
Following libraries were used: pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, lightgbm  

## Toxic comments classification

This project aimed to create a model which can distinguish toxic and non-toxic comments with a minimum F1 score of 0.75.
Labeled data contains text comment in text and target in toxic. For feature engineering, TF-IDF was used. 
Following libraries were used: pandas, nltk, sklearn, matplotlib, lightgbm, torch, spacy

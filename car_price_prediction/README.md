# Car price prediction
## Description
This project aims to create a model capable of fast cars price prediction based on their characteristics. 
For this purpose the historical data of car sales compiled from different sources were used. There are technical characteristics, prices, vehicle configurations.

It was important to compare different models and choose the best taking into account:
- metric score (RMSE)
- prediction speed
- model training time

Following libraries were used:
pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, lightgbm
 ## Results
 Data were preprocessed, several models were created and compared according to the task. Every trained model showed better performance than the prediction by a median. The gradient boosting model showed the best results.

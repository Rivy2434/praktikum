# Car price prediction

This project aimsto create a model capable of fast cars price prediction based on their characteristics. 
For this purpose the historical data of car sales compiled from different sources were used. There are technical characteristics, prices, vehicle configurations.

It was important to compare different models and choose the best taking into account 
- metric score (RMSE)
- prediction speed
- model training time

Following libraries were used:
pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, lightgbm
